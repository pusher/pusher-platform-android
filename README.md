## Installation

### Gradle

In your `build.gradle` file, add this line:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    api 'com.pusher:pusher-platform-android:$pusher_platform_version'
}
```

## Usage

The main entity used to access to platform services is [Instance](pusher-platform-core/src/main/kotlin/com/pusher/platform/Instance.kt).

The simpler way to create a new instance uses 4 things:

* `locator`: Instance locator id in the form of 'v1:us1:1a234-123a-1234-12a3-1234123aa12'
* `serviceName`: The name of the service this instance will use
* `serviceVersion`: The version of the service
* `dependencies`: An object containing the requirements for the instance. The default implementation for Android provides all that is needed in `com.pusher.platform.AndroidDependencies`

Examples:

```kotlin
class KotlinExample {
    val instance = Instance(
         locator = "v1:us1:1a234-123a-1234-12a3-1234123aa12",
         serviceName = "service",
         serviceVersion = "v1",
         dependencies = AndroidDependencies()
    )
}
```

```java
class JavaExample {
    Instance instance = new Instance(
        "v1:us1:1a234-123a-1234-12a3-1234123aa12",
        "service",
        "v1",
        new AndroidDependencies()
    );
}

```


## Testing

We use Junit 5 and/or Spek to run unit and integration tests. In `pusher-platform-core` we have two test folders. Unit tests can be located in `test` and integration tests in `integrationTest`. In order to run integration tests locally we have to do a couple of extra steps. They can be found [here](pusher-platform-core/src/integrationTest/Readme.md).
