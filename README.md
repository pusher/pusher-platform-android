## Installation

### Gradle

In the `build.gradle` for your app make sure you have `jcenter()` repository as one of your repositories:

```groovy
repositories {
    // other repos i.e. google()
    jcenter()
}
```


Then add this dependency when targeting Android: 

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    api 'com.pusher:pusher-platform-android:$pusher_platform_version'
}
```

The latest version can be found here: 

[![Android](https://api.bintray.com/packages/pusher/maven/pusher-platform-android/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/pusher/maven/pusher-platform-android/_latestVersion)

Alternatively, if you want to target JVM 1.7 and upwards you can add this line:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    api 'com.pusher:pusher-platform-core:$pusher_platform_version'
}
```

With the latest version for Core found here: 

[![Core](https://api.bintray.com/packages/pusher/maven/pusher-platform-core/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/pusher/maven/pusher-platform-core/_latestVersion)

## Usage

The main entity used to access to platform services is [Instance](pusher-platform-core/src/main/kotlin/com/pusher/platform/Instance.kt).

The simpler way to create a new instance uses 4 things:

* `locator`: Instance locator id in the form of 'v1:us1:1a234-123a-1234-12a3-1234123aa12'
* `serviceName`: The name of the service this instance will use
* `serviceVersion`: The version of the service
* `dependencies`: An object containing the requirements for the instance. The default implementation for Android provides all that is needed in `com.pusher.platform.AndroidDependencies`

Examples:

```kotlin
class KotlinExample {
    val instance = Instance(
         locator = "v1:us1:1a234-123a-1234-12a3-1234123aa12",
         serviceName = "service",
         serviceVersion = "v1",
         dependencies = AndroidDependencies()
    )
}
```

```java
class JavaExample {
    Instance instance = new Instance(
        "v1:us1:1a234-123a-1234-12a3-1234123aa12",
        "service",
        "v1",
        new AndroidDependencies()
    );
}

```


## Testing

We use Junit 5 and/or Spek to run unit and integration tests. In `pusher-platform-core` we have two test folders. Unit tests can be located in `test` and integration tests in `integrationTest`. In order to run integration tests locally we have to do a couple of extra steps. They can be found [here](pusher-platform-core/src/integrationTest/Readme.md).

## Publishing

The two artifacts this project produces (`pusher-platform-core` and `pusher-platform-android`) are published in `jCenter`.

Firstly, make sure you have a [BinTray](https://bintray.com) account. To get the api key go to Profile > Edit > Api Key

Then you need to set up a user name and api key.
 
Either on your local `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` as:

```properties

bintrayUser=you-bintray-user-name
bintrayApiKey=your-bintray-api-key
```

Or as environment variables (mainly for CI):

```bash
BINTRAY_USER=you-bintray-user-name
BINTRAY_API_KEY=your-bintray-api-key
```

Now, to do the actual release run:

```bash
gradlew bintrayUpload
```

**Note:** The publish action will both override the current release (if it has the same version name as the current) and automatically publish the new version.
